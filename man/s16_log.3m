.SH NAME
\fBs16_log \fP- log to aribitrary base
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
#include "s16math.h"
qm_n \fBs16_log\fP(qm_n \fIa\fP, qm_n \fIn\fP);
.fam T

.SH DESCRIPTION
Evaluates log to base \fIa\fP of \fIn\fP, where 0 < \fIn\fP <= 327.67 (decimal resolution),
or 255.127 (Q8.7). Requesting the log of \fIa\fP negative number is treated as
an error instead of \fRa multiple of \fIi\fP.
.PP
The logarithm is evaluated as \fBs16_ln\fP(\fIn\fP)/\fBs16_ln\fP(\fIa\fP).
.SH PARAMETERS
Parameters are supplied as 16 bit integers having an implied decimal
point with two digits of resolution or an implied binary point with seven
bits of resolution.
.TP
.B
\fIa\fP
base of logarithm.
.TP
.B
\fIn\fP
numeric argument with two decimal digits or seven bits of resolution.
.SH RETURN
The return value is \fRa 16 bit integer having an implied decimal point with
two digits of resolution or an implied binary point with seven bits of
resolution.
.PP
If 0 < \fIn\fP <= 327.67 (255.127 if binary resolution), then the return value
is the number to which base \fIa\fP would have to be raised to yield \fIn\fP.
A return of \fR-\fP99.00 means \fIn\fP <= 0 or \fIn\fP > 327.67 (255.127).
.SH NOTES
The accuracy of this function is very poor. Due to limitations in
precision and rounding errors most results differ from those of the
reference implementation by more than one part in 100. Some results
differ from those of the reference implementation by as much as seven
parts in 100.
