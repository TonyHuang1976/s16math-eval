.SH NAME
\fBs16_sincos \fP- sine and cosine
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.fam C
#include "s16math.h" s32 \fBs16_sincos\fP(qm_rad \fIz\fP);
.fam T

.SH DESCRIPTION
Computes sine and cosine of angle \fIz\fP. \fIz\fP is unwound as needed to fall in
the range \fR-\fPpi/2 <= \fIz\fP <= pi/2.
.SH PARAMETER
.TP
.B
\fIz\fP
numeric argument is an angle in radians supplied as a 16 bit integer
having an implied binary point with 10 bits of resolution, or an implied
decimal point with three digits of resolution.
.SH RETURN
Sine and cosine are returned in a structure with two 16 bit signed
integers in a 32 bit union containing a structure with two 16 bit members.
Cosine is returned in the cos member. Sine is returned in the
\fRsin member\fP. sin, cos range from \fR-\fP1.00 through 1.00 inclusive.
