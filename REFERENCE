INTRODUCTION
============
    s16math is a compact library of 16 bit fixed point[1] math functions
    for microcontroller - MCU - environments without fixed or floating point
    hardware. All functions are re-entrant, thread safe, and fully
    interruptible.

    The development platform is Devuan Linux running on an X86-64 machine
    using basic GNU/Linux cross compilation development tools. The package
    lets you build deployable applications using object versions of the
    library for a variety of targets.

    Capabilities are well suited to processor and memory constrained
    embedded applications such as resource limited battery powered sensors
    and wearable medical devices. MCUs such as the HC08, HC11, 8051, Z80,
    and ARM machines operating in 16-bit mode are supported, maximizing
    use of limited MCU registers while avoiding the software overhead of
    32 and 64 bit operations, preserving a small memory footprint.

    The trigonometric and math functions make the library well suited for
    software defined radio - SDR - signal management requirements.

    The virtual fixed point format provides 65,536 discrete signed values
    between -32768 and +32767 inclusive, with an equivalent decimal fixed
    point range of -327.68 through +327.67. If binary resolution is used, the
    range is -256.000 through +255.127 (see text on dot (".") notation below).
    If your application requires numbers outside this range, then this
    masterpiece - alas - is not for you.

    Machine level integers are treated as virtual fixed point[1] numbers with
    sign, integer, and fractional parts specified in either decimal or
    Qm.n[2] format. The most significant bit is the sign bit, leaving 15 bits
    to be allocated between the integer and the fractional components.
    
    Numbers are a ratio of two integers: the numerator is kept in storage,
    the denominator is implied and is equal to either a power of 10 or a
    power of 2. The integer and fractional parts are given by the integer
    division of the whole number by the denominator: the integer portion is
    the quotient and the fractional part is the remainder. A dot (".")
    notation is used to separate the integer and fractional portions of the
    number when it is displayed.

    If exact fractional powers of ten are desired, then a decimal format
    should be used[1]. This provides more range than the binary format, but
    less resolution.

    So where the denominator is 100, the number 30 is treated as 30/100, or
    0.30; 250 is treated as 250/100, or 2.50. In this library, decimal
    denominators of 10, 100, and 1000 are used.

    The advantage of the Qm.n format is that the rounding operations needed
    to preserve precision in fixed point multiplication and division may be
    done with simple bit shifts instead, which can significantly boost
    performance and save code overhead in machines without hardware support
    for integer multiplication and division.

    In Qm.n format 'm' is the number of bits in the integer portion of the
    number, and 'n' is the number of bits in the fractional part. The
    denominator is a constant equal to 2^n[2].

    So where n is 6, 2^n is 64, and the number 30 is treated as 30/64 (0.30);
    250 is treated as 250/64, or 3 58/64 (3.58). Where n is 7, 2^n is 128,
    and the number 30 is treated as 30/128 (0.030); 250 is treated as 250/128,
    or 1 122/128 (1.122) etc. In this library, Q11.4, Q8.7, and Q5.10 formats
    are used.

    The number pi is handled as having the equivalent of approximately three
    decimal digits of resolution - 3.142. To handle the needed range of
    degree units, a Qm.n format equivalent to approximately a single decimal
    digit of resolution is used - 360.0.

    Numbers are displayed with a point (".") format to separate the integer
    and fractional parts. The fractional part is the numerator of a fraction
    of which the denominator is the chosen decimal or binary resolution.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================
    The development platform is Devuan Linux running on an X86-64 machine
    using basic GNU/Linux cross compilation development tools. The package
    lets you build deployable object versions of the library for a variety
    of targets.

    If you are compiling a program to use the s16math library functions in
    a language other than C, the compiler you use needs to understand the
    'extern "C"' construct.

    The following table lists the supported MCUs and the compiler used to
    compile each.

    Target      Compiler    Package

    z80         sdcc        Devuan, Ubuntu, maybe others.

    * Dropped pending resolution of SDCC - Microchip header license issue.

    The SDCC compiler generates little endian code, so versions of the
    library built with it are also little endian. The Keil compiler
    generates big endian code. To use the Keil compiler with the s16math
    library, you need to byte swap call parameters and returned values, or
    purchase a source license for the library and port the code to Keil.

    To compile the example programs you need the GNU C compiler or
    equivalent for the x86 example, Microchip's XC16 compiiler for the
    pic24f example, and one of the ARM cross compile packages for the KL46Z
    example. Your compile environment needs to have stdint.h in its standard
    lookup path.

(1) The ARM cross compiler seems to handle a wider variety of ARM MCUs.

FUNCTIONS
=========
    This section lists the functions provided by s16math. Their man pages
    can be found in the man subdirectory. Use the "man -l" command to read
    them. For example, the command "man -l ./man/s16_div.3m" will display
    the man page for the s16_div function.

    You can also point your browser to the html subdirectory to read the
    man pages in html format.

    All functions are leaf functions. No library function calls any other
    function that is not in the library, except where the compiler emits
    function calls for multiply ("*") and divide ("/") operators on machines
    without hardware support for those operations.

QUALITY ASSURANCE
=================
    This section discusses accuracy and speed of the library functions.

    Accuracy
    --------
    All source code for the library compiles for all machine architectures
    without error or warning messages using the '-Wall' and '-pedantic'
    flags where supported by the compiler for the machine architecture.
    The SDCC compiler does not support those flags.

    All math functions in the s16math library are tested for correct output by
    comparing the output of each function with that of a corresponding
    reference function and verifying that the respective results differ by
    less than some threshold - such as +/- 0.01.

    Library functions are tested for accuracy on the development system.
    Each library function has a small C language test fixture that accepts
    numerical input parameter(s) on the command line, calls the function
    under test, then formats and prints the result on stdout. The
    corresponding reference function is a bash script that accepts numerical
    input, invokes GNU bc, then prints the result on stdout.

    An evaluator bash script invokes both the test fixture and the
    corresponding reference script, compares their results, then outputs the
    difference between the two. A validator script flags differences at or
    greater than what is allowable.

    Higher level scripts allow looping through a computed set of values
    to establish correct output over a range of inputs.

    Speed
    -----
    Excution speed is measured for a selected subset of the s16math library
    functions compiled with seven bits of binary precision for the
    Microchip pic24f-based development starter kit board running at 8MHz
    (4MHz instruction cycle). Times for the XC16 compiler- generated
    integer multiply and divide functions are included as baseline
    references.
    
    Where appropriate, results are shown for more than one algorithm. In
    general, it seems bigger numbers take longer to compute.

    Because of their faster speed, series expansions are used for the arc
    tangent and natural log library functions.

EVALUATION PACKAGE
==================
    The evaluation package may be used for evaluation or personal use. See
    COPYING for specifics. It has archive and shared object versions of the
    library that can be linked with programs written in C, or with any
    program written a language that understands the 'extern "C"' construct.

    The evaluation package unpacks into the directory "s16math-eval-<rev>",
    where <rev> is a three part revision number in the form x.y.z. It
    contains a set of core files and pre- built libraries for a variety of
    embedded architectures.

    Core Files

    Library Files
    -------------
    Library files for various machine architectures are in subdirectories
    named "arch-binary" for functions compiled for Qm.n format and
    arch-decimal" for functions compiled in decimal format.

    If you need a version of the library not shown here, post a request on
    the project host and - if possible - I'll include it with what is
    already published here.

    * Dropped pending resolution of SDCC - Microchip header license issue.

    All versions of the library are compiled in a Devuan Linux environment
    using the GNU C/C++ toolchains for the generic x86, and AVR code. ARM
    code is compiled using the Embedded ARM toolchain. Code for the various
    MCUs is compiled using the sdcc package for the Small Device C Compiler
    (SDCC). Microchip's xc16 compiler is used for pic24 code.

    ARM code is compiled in thumb mode for cortex-m0 and armv6-m. Big endian
    compilation of ARM source files currently create ar archives, but
    creating shared object files fail.

EXAMPLES
========
    Code in the examples directory shows the use of functions in the
    s16math library. Currently, there are versions of one program which
    compiles for the x86, Microchip pic24f development board, and the
    Freescale KLZ46 development board.

    Each version of multest accepts two integer parameters on the command
    line, converts them to hex, then calls s16_mul() to do a fixed point
    multiplication, followed by a call to s16_mulov() to check for overflow.
    Results are printed to stdout.

    To build the example code, change to the examples directory and peruse
    the information in the README file there.

COMPILING AND LINKING
=====================
    Your compile environment needs to have stdint.h in its standard lookup
    path. The storage unit definitions it contains are used in s16math.h.

    Using The Evaluation Package
    ----------------------------
    The libraries in the evaluation package may be used with any linker that
    understands either the shared object or archive Unix library file
    format. At this time, not all compilations produce a shared object
    version, so make sure the machine architecture directory you select has
    the .so, .a, or .lib suffix you want to use. To build your program,
    insert this statement in your source file(s):

    #include "s16math.h"

    and include a reference to the library on the compile command line. To
    use decimal resolution, select a directory under arch-decimal. Use
    arch-binary for Qm.n format.

    Makefile Template
    -----------------
    Several cross compilers are used to buld the library files. This
    template may be used as a guide for using the SDCC cross compiler:

        # selects Qm.n binary. Comment out for decimal.
        CFLAGS +=-DUSE_BINARY_POINT
        CC:=sdcc
        SUFFIX:=lib
        IPATH:=<path-to-s16math-include-directory>

        # point to {arch-binary|arch-decimal}/<machine-type>
        LPATH:=<path-to-s16math-library-directory>

        myprog: myprog.c
            $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $@.c -I$(IPATH) $(LPATH)/s16math.$(SUFFIX)

REPORTING PROBLEMS
==================
    Questions about the evaluation package may be posted in the forums
    provided by the software project host. Please provide the following
    information when reporting a problem:

    o What version of the library was used.
