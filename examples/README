Introduction
------------
The source program(s) in this directory show examples of using the s16math
library functions.

Each subdirectory has an executable version of a test fixture that invokes
the s16math library multiply function and prints the results. The program
multest accepts two decimal integer values as input, calls s16_mul() to
form the product, then calls s16_mulov() to check for overflow.

If you have the required compiler tools, you can also build the executables
from the source in each subdirectory.

x86
---
To build multest, cd to the x86 subdirectory, then invoke make with "make",
or "make ARCH=x86-64". Add BINARY=1 on the make command line to select Qm.n
number format. Otherwise, decimal format is used.

    make                    to build executables that run on generic
                            64 bit x86 machine.
    make BINARY=1           to select Qm.n format on a generic 64 bit x86
                            machine.

To execute the example, enter "./multest" followed by two decimal integers.
"./multest -h" gives help information.

Example runs of multest:

    Command                 Output
    -------------------     -----------------
    > multest 16383 200     163.83*2.00=327.66

    > multest 16384 200     163.84*2.00=-327.68
                            overflow

    Overflow occurred because multiplying two numbers with the same sign
    yielded a product with a different sign.

kl46z
-----
The example is built for the Freescale FRDM-KL46Z development board using
an ARM Cortex M0+ processor. Source files are adapted from files downloaded
from mbed.org. The program multest.bin asks for two numbers interactively,
calls s16_mul() to form the product, then calls s16_mulov to check for
overflow.

To build multest, cd to the kl46z subdirectory, then invoke make with "make".
Add BINARY=1 on the make command line to select Qm.n number format. Otherwise,
decimal format is used.

To execute the example - multest.bin - you need to have the development board
attached via USB and mounted as a mass storage device. This document assumes
you have lines in /etc/fstab like:

    /dev/sdb    /mnt/mbed           auto users,noauto,nodev 0 2
    /dev/sdb1   /mnt/bootloader     auto users,noauto,nodev 0 2

Open a terminal window such as xterm, then do the following:

1. Download multest.bin from here to /mnt/mbed.

   > cp multest.bin /mnt/mbed

2. After a bit, the little light on the board should blink for a while. Wait
   for it to stop blinking. /mnt/mbed should now be unmounted. If it is not,
   unmount it, then wait for the little light to stop blinking.

3. Invoke a terminal emulator. The picocom package available in Ubuntu and
   Debian distributions gives a simple command line interface to the test
   program. It may be invoked as:

   > picocom --imap lfcrlf --omap crcrlf /dev/ttyACM0

4. When you press the reset switch on the development board, multest will
   prompt for two values, perform the multiply after receiving the second
   value, print the result, then request another pair of values. This
   sequence stops when you enter an EOT (^D) character.

5. To exit the picocom terminal emulator, enter ^A^Q (Ctrl-a, then Ctrl-q).

6. When the terminal prompt appears, remount the USB mass storage device.

   > mount /mnt/mbed

Example run of multest compiled with "make BINARY=1":

    Command                 Output
    -------------------     -----------------
    args> 32767 128         255.127*1.000=255.127,t=3 us

    args> 32768 128         -256.000*1.000=-256.000,t=3 us

    args> 32767 256         255.127*2.000=-0.002,t=2 us
                            overflow

    Seven bits of resolution means that each integer is treated as the
    numerator of a fraction whose implicit denominator is 128. A dot (.)
    notation is used to display the fixed point equivalent of the numbers.
    The integer portion is shown to the left of the `.', and the fractional
    part to the right.
    
    So 32767/128 = 255 + 127/128, displayed as 255.127. 32768 is actually
    a negative 16 bit number with a value of -32768. Since -32768/128 is
    -256 + 0/128, -256.000 is displayed.
    
    128/128 is 1 + 0/128, displayed as 1.000. 256/128 = 2 + 0/128, displayed
    as 2.000.

    Overflow occurred because multiplying two numbers with the same sign
    yielded a product with a different sign.
