</p>
<p>    This document enumerates the terms and conditions of using the s16math
    packages.
</p><ul>
  <li>All matter is copyrighted.
  </li><li>There is no warranty.
  </li><li>Specifications may change without notice at any time.
  </li><li>Derivative works are not allowed.
  </li><li>Support is provided at my sole discretion.
</li></ul>
<p>    All language here is still tentative, preliminary, and subject to
    possibly extensive revision.
</p>
<p>    All source may be changed as you wish.
</p>
<h3><a name="section_1_1_1">Evaluation Package</a></h3>
<p>    The evaluation package is available for free from:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Atmel     <a href="https://gallery.atmel.com/Products/List">https://gallery.atmel.com/Products/List</a>
  </li><li>Microchip <a href="http://embeddedcodesource.com/algorithms">http://embeddedcodesource.com/algorithms</a>
</li></ul>
<p>    It may be used without charge for evaluation, or for personal use.
    Components may be modified as you wish, so long as the personal use
    constraint is followed.
</p>
<h3><a name="section_1_1_2">Licenses</a></h3>
<p>    Development of language for licenses is preliminary, tentative, and
    incomplete. So things are probably going to change here.
</p>
<p>    The product is available for commercial use under either a binary
    license or a source license. For pricing, send an email (plain text
    preferred ) with "RFQ" or "Request For Quote" in the subject line to:
</p>
<p>    &lt;<a href="mailto:bjbatten@acm.org">bjbatten@acm.org</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>    Terms apply to the version of the library available for download at the
    time of purchase. Licenses are "at will" and may be terminated by either
    party. There are no refunds.
</p>
<h4><a name="section_1_1_2_1">Binary License</a></h4>
<p>    The binary license allows you to incorporate binaries from the current
    and later versions of the evaluation package into your own product and
    sell or lease it.
</p>
<p>    Support for six months is included in the price, and is available after
    that for an hourly fee. Support extends to fixing errors in the math
    functions. As bugs are fixed, the fixed object file is immediately made
    available to the customer, and is put in the evaluation package as part
    of the normal release schedule. Also, I will provide machine architecture
    object versions directly to the customer if they are not available in the
    standard evaluation package, and can be made from the available compilers.
    Those versions of the library are then made available in the standard
    evaluation package as part of the normal release schedule.
</p>
<p>    The binary license is available for an advance on royalties. Royalties
    are set as a percentage of the unit sale price.
</p>
<p>    If the binary license is terminated, you no longer pay royalties, and
    you may no longer include the library in your product.
</p>
<p>    Support for changes made to source components of the evaluation package
    is available for an hourly fee plus materials.
</p>
<h4><a name="section_1_1_2_2">Source License</a></h4>
<p>    The source license makes the full source for all the math functions,
    test code, and build facilities available to you. You may optimize the
    library code for your specific application and incorporate the result
    into your own product. You can build customized versions of the library
    using both "Make" variables that can be overridden on the command line,
    and by selecting among specified conditional compilation options
    available in the product source files.
</p>
<p>    The following enumerated source change types are supported:
</p>
<p>    First, variables defined in the file "Makefile" in the top level
    directory as:
</p>
<pre>
    Name     Assignment
    ----     ----------
    var      ?=[&lt;initial value&gt;]
</pre>
<p>    may be overridden on the command line.
</p>
<p>    Second, conditional definition macros of the form:
</p>
<pre>
    #ifdef     USE_&lt;filename&gt;<u>&lt;option&gt;
    #undef     USE</u>&lt;filename&gt;_&lt;option&gt;
</pre>
<p>    where &lt;filename&gt; is an upper case version of the file name (without the
    ".c" extension) and &lt;option&gt; is a descriptive term such as "TABLE", or
    "NTHROOT", may be interchanged to allow you to select among algorithms
    where more than one algorithm is available.
</p>
<p>    Code within the scope of undefined USE_xxx constants compiles - mostly
    (I think) - but may not work. In most cases disabled algorithms may use
    less code, but provide poorer accuracy, than the one enabled by default.
    
</p><p>    Support for six months is included in the price, and is available after
    that for an hourly fee. Source updates are provided at no charge.
</p>
<p>    The source license is available for a fixed fee. Binaries made from
    either modified or unmodified source can be distributed for a royalty
    set as a percentage of the unit sale price.
</p>
<p>    If the source license is terminated, you no longer pay royalties, and
    you may no longer include the library in your product.
</p>
<p>    You may make any other source code changes you wish. Support for those
    changes is available for an hourly fee plus materials.
</p>
<h3><a name="section_1_1_3">Support</a></h3>
<p>    Problems submitted for support are evaluated solely by myself to
    determine need.
</p>
<p>    Support for the evaluation package is available through the contact
    developer facility at the host sites and in online forums.
</p>
<p>    Support for binary and source licensees is available via email, Skype,
    and phone.
</p>
<p>    Anyone may submit code changes to be included in the product if you
    allow me to copyright it as a derivative work. User submitted code
    changes must be made in the form of a patch in "diff -U" format attached
    to a plain text email.
</p>
<p>    The title of the email should contain the word "PATCH". The body of the
    email must contain language that allows me to  copyright it as a
    derivative work, subject to acceptance of the patch.
</p>
<p>    The first lines of the patch must insert a copyright notice behind the
    latest copyright notice in the file to be patched, and then insert
    language allowing copyright by me as a derivative work.
</p>
<p>    If accepted, the patch may be modified in any way. The resulting code
    will be made available as part of the product and provided with
    standard support.
