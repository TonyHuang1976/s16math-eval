<p>    It may be used for evaluation or personal use without charge.
    Components may be modified as you wish, so long as the personal use
    constraint is followed.
</p>
<p>    If no version of the library in the evaluation package has the object
    format you need, email me on your company letterhead at:
    
</p><p>    &lt;<a href="mailto:bjbatten@acm.org">bjbatten@acm.org</a>&gt;
    
</p><p>    If it can be built from the compilers available to me, I will email you
    a custom archive build and include it in subsequent iterations of the
    evaluation package.
</p>
<h3><a name="section_1_1_2">Licenses</a></h3>
<p>    The product is available for commercial use under either a binary
    license or a source license. For pricing, send an email (plain text
    preferred) with "RFQ" or "Request For Quote" in the subject line to:
</p>
<p>    &lt;<a href="mailto:bjbatten@acm.org">bjbatten@acm.org</a>&gt;
</p>
<p>    Terms at the time of purchase apply to all versions of the library.
</p>
<p>    Licenses are "at will" and may be terminated by either party. There are
    no refunds. The license is effective when funds are deposited into my
    Paypal account. To do this, log in to Paypal, click on "Send and
    Request" -&gt; "Pay for goods or services" and enter <a href="mailto:bjbatten@acm.org">bjbatten@acm.org</a> in
    the email address field.
</p>
<h4><a name="section_1_1_2_1">Binary License</a></h4>
<p>    The binary license is available on a per unit royalty basis, and
    becomes active on receipt of an advance payment which is applied to the
    per unit royalty. Royalties are assessed in US dollars and are set at
    1.5% of the unit sale price.
</p>
<p>    The binary license allows you to incorporate binaries from the current
    and later versions of the evaluation package into your own product.
</p>
<p>    If the binary license is terminated, you no longer pay royalties, and
    you may no longer include the library in your product.
</p>
<h4><a name="section_1_1_2_2">Source License</a></h4>
<p>    The source license is available for a fixed fee. Full source for all
    the math functions, test code, and build facilities is provided to you.
    You may modify all source code as you wish. Source updates are provided
    at no charge as they become available.
</p>
<p>    Binaries made from either modified or unmodified source, and binaries
    from the versions of the library in the evaluation package, can be
    distributed on the per unit royalty basis of binary license, without
    the advance payment requirement.
</p>
<p>    Anyone may submit code changes to be included in the product if you
    allow me to copyright it as a derivative work. User submitted code
    changes should be made in the form of a patch in "diff -U" format
    attached to a plain text email.
</p>
<p>    The title of the email should contain the word "PATCH". The body of the
    email must contain language that allows me to copyright it as a
    derivative work, subject to acceptance of the patch.
</p>
<p>    The first lines of the patch must insert a copyright notice behind the
    latest copyright notice in the file to be patched, and then insert
    language allowing copyright by me as a derivative work.
</p>
<p>    If accepted, the patch may be modified in any way. The resulting code
    will be made available as part of the product.
</p>
<p>    If the source license is terminated, you no longer pay royalties, and
    you may no longer include the library in your product.
